🌱 My Daily DSA Practice (Beginner Journey)

Hi! This repository is my small corner on the internet where I upload the DSA questions I solve daily on LeetCode.
I’m still a beginner, learning step by step, and this repo helps me stay consistent and motivated.

I’m not perfect at DSA, but I’m trying to get better every day — one problem at a time. 🙂

✨ Why I’m Doing This

I started this because:

I want to build a strong foundation in DSA

I want to improve my logical thinking

I want to get comfortable with coding interviews

And most importantly… I want to make learning a daily habit

Even if I solve just one question a day, it still counts as progress. 💪

📂 What’s Inside This Repo

You will find:

My daily LeetCode solutions

Beginner-friendly code

Simple approaches (nothing too fancy)

Others

🛠️ Tools / Language I Use

Mostly Java
(And I’ll explore more languages once I get comfortable.)

🎯 My Goals (Honestly)

Become consistent with DSA

Slowly move from easy → medium → hard problems

Understand concepts properly instead of just memorizing solutions

Build confidence in coding interviews

I’m not in a hurry — I just want to get better slowly and steadily.

💬 A Small Note

I’m still learning, so some solutions might be basic or not fully optimized.
But that’s okay. This is my learning journey, and I’ll improve with time.
