🌱 My Everyday DSA Practice

This repo is where I upload the DSA questions I solve daily on LeetCode.
I’m still learning, still figuring things out, and this space helps me stay consistent and motivated.

I’m not great at DSA yet — but I’m improving a little bit every day. 🙂

✨ Why I Started This Journey

I began this because:

I want a strong grip on DSA

I want to think better and solve problems smarter

I want to feel confident during coding interviews

And honestly… I want to build a daily learning habit

Even one small problem a day is still progress. 💪

📂 What You’ll Find Here

Inside this repo, you’ll see:

My daily LeetCode solutions

Beginner-level code

Easy-to-follow logic

Problems sorted by different topics

📁 Current Topics

Arrays, Strings, HashMap, TwoPointers, LinkedList, Stack, Recursion, Others
More folders will keep coming as I learn new things.

🛠️ What I’m Using

Mostly Java for now.
I’ll explore other languages once I get more confident.

🎯 My Real Goals

Stay consistent with DSA

Slowly level up from easy → medium → hard

Understand concepts instead of copying solutions

Build up interview confidence

No shortcuts — just steady growth.

💬 A Little Note

Since I’m still learning, some solutions might be simple or not fully optimized.
But that’s part of the process, and I’m okay with that.
